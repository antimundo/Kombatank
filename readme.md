# About this project
This was a prototype to make a local multiplayer game with Unity, but it was never finished.

I managed to support multiple controllers at the same time using the new [Unity Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.8/manual/index.html).

I **really dislike** the new Unity Input System, but is the default the way to support multiple controllers if you are using Unity, so you just have to embrace that shit.

## Open source

The code of this prototype is not very good, but you can use it to see how to support multiple controllers with the new Unity Input System.
